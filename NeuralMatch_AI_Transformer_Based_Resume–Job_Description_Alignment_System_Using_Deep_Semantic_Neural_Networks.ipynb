        "The objective of NeuralMatch AI is to design and implement a deep learning–powered Resume Screening and ATS Scoring System that leverages advanced neural network architectures, specifically Transformer-based sentence embeddings, to evaluate semantic alignment between a candidate’s resume and a job description.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project emphasizes the application of modern deep neural networks in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to move beyond traditional keyword matching and enable contextual understanding of text.\n",
        "\n",
        "The system aims to:\n",
        "\n",
        "Utilize Transformer-based neural networks (Sentence-BERT) to generate high-dimensional semantic embeddings of resume and job description content.\n",
        "\n",
        "Compute contextual similarity using cosine similarity in embedding space.\n",
        "\n",
        "Integrate traditional NLP techniques (TF-IDF) with deep semantic representations for hybrid scoring.\n",
        "\n",
        "Quantify recruiter-relevant signals such as action verbs, measurable impact, and keyword alignment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Produce a weighted, recruiter-grade ATS score reflecting real-world hiring evaluation logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "By combining deep representation learning with statistical text analysis, this project demonstrates how neural networks can model human-like understanding in recruitment automation systems."
